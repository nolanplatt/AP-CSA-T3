# Team Anti Squirrel Task Force üêøÔ∏è üö´ | AP CSA T3  

## PBL Idea
We created an enterprise-facing finances platform that allows corporations to manage funds and wages, optimize workflow, and predict stock futures. This is a tool for companies, big or small, to make day-to-day operations easier, allowing them to focus on more important company-related work.

Potential features include:
- Stock predictor that uses a trained machine learning model
- Manager reports where directors can give status updates, reviews, and comments to administative officers quickly
- Finance tracker that logs purchases, profits, and investments.
