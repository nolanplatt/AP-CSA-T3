# Team Anti Squirrel Task Force üêøÔ∏è üö´ | AP CSA T3 

## PBL Idea
We created an enterprise-facing finances platform that allows corporations to manage funds and wages, optimize workflow, and predict stock futures. This is a tool for companies, big or small, to make day-to-day operations easier, allowing them to focus on more important company-related work.
