# Overall Plan

- As provided by our project owner (Mr. Hendricks, AP Environmental Science teacher), we will do our best to fulfill the requirements for the project as specified.
- In short, the website will contain a dynamic map, a map that informs people in the community of environmental problems near there, whether it be a tree that has fallen on the street, a large puddle, or anything else out of the ordinary. We plan on having a user authentication system such that not anyone can just visit the website and change the map (this information will be held using firebase authentication or an SQL database)

## Objectives

- Dynamic map that can have mini-events placed in by users
- User authentication
- Possible incorporation of a blog site with information on environmental issues and efforts to combat them

## How these objectives are meeting sponsor's needs

- Our teacher mentioned that an environmental mapper was a really good idea as a way for people to safely be warned of dangers on the road in front of them. He mentioned that it was a practical application of the popular app Waze
- He beleives that the best way to deal with environmental problems is to spread awareness of it and that is why we decided to incorporate a blog site into our project as well
- He gave us some pointers on possible ways to verify new users before allowing them to add to the map
- We will consider all of these factors when working on our project.

## How these objectives will be met

- Utilizing an organized scrumboard, team members will always be able to know what tasks they currently have on hand and will have a structured plan of action that includes deadlines, specific task requirements, and short term goals
- We will frequently consult with our sponsor to ensure that our project is on the right track to align with his requirements
